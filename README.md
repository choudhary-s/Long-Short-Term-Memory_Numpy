Through this I have tried to understand the concept of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network. 

I have implemented a single cell LSTM first, before implementing multiple cell LSTM.

This code is inspired from a post by Kulbear.

I thank Prof. Andrew Ng and Kulbear to help me understand the concept and implement the same.
